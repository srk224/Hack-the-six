# Code Cure

## Inspiration
While attending Hack the 6ix, our team had a chance to speak to Advait from the Warp team. We learned about terminals, his involvement with Warp, and his interest in developing something innovative for the 21st century. Inspired by this interaction, we decided to create an AI-powered developer tool, which led to the inception of Code Cure!

## What it does
Code Cure can execute your Python files and display the output in your terminal. If your code encounters any errors, our extension provides suggestions in a pop-up on how to resolve them.

## How we built it
We utilized Azure's OpenAI service to power our AI-driven code fixing suggestions. The rest of the logic behind our VS Code extension is implemented using JavaScript.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully developed an AI-powered tool that assists users in fixing errors in their Python code. We believe this project will act as a gateway for more people to learn programming by providing an easier way to troubleshoot their errors.

## What's next for Code Cure
Currently, our output is displayed through a pop-up on the user's screen. In the future, we aim to implement a stylized tab where we can present users with various suggestions using the most advanced AI models available to us.
